#If weights are improving from before, 
#Generally, we should increase bigger weights more and smaller weights less as it seems bigger weights are more important
#square is to make sure itâ€™s not linear, and for other reasons later explained
#This makes it like you are speeding up or slowing down, sine function fluctuation used before
#square also makes the speed up of individual factors more different, to explore different "offsets" or "phases" better
#does reverse direction if zero or negative, one 
#normalization keeps it bounded
#unitVector function was found to be faster than using a pure NumPy implementation
#This new loss function is cleaner, and is based on differences between weights with sign being preserved
#this makes it grow along derivative of function or negative derivative, so if things looking good with decreasing values for some
#it decreases, if things look good with increasing it increases
#and if it looked bad it flips direction
