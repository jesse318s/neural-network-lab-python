# Advanced TensorFlow Lab: Custom Weight Modification and Adaptive Loss Functions

A comprehensive TensorFlow implementation featuring custom weight constraints, adaptive loss functions, and comprehensive performance tracking for particle physics simulations. _This project was created by a local GitHub Copilot agent using an AI-generated and human-edited POML prompt with the Claude Sonnet 4 model._

## Overview

This lab demonstrates advanced neural network training techniques including:

- **Binary Weight Constraints**: Control binary precision of neural network weights
- **Oscillation Dampening**: Prevent weight oscillations during training
- **Adaptive Loss Functions**: Dynamically combine MSE and MAE based on training progress
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics collection with CSV export
- **Railway Programming**: Error handling that allows graceful degradation

## Features

### Weight Modification Algorithms

1. **Binary Precision Change Control** (`BinaryWeightConstraintChanges`)

   - Constrains new weights to have only one additional significant binary digit
   - Prevents explosive weight growth while maintaining precision

2. **Maximum Binary Precision Control** (`BinaryWeightConstraintMax`)

   - Limits total binary digits in weight representations
   - Ensures memory efficiency and numerical stability

3. **Oscillation Dampening** (`OscillationDampener`)
   - Monitors weights across consecutive epochs
   - Detects up-down-up or down-up-down patterns
   - Sets smallest non-zero binary digit to zero when oscillation detected

### Adaptive Loss Functions

1. **Epoch-Based Weighting**: Adjusts MSE/MAE ratio based on training epoch

   - Early epochs: Emphasize MAE for robustness
   - Later epochs: Emphasize MSE for precision

2. **Accuracy-Based Weighting**: Modifies loss weights based on validation accuracy

   - Low accuracy: Favor MAE for stability
   - High accuracy: Favor MSE for fine-tuning

3. **Loss-Based Weighting**: Adapts weights based on previous loss values

   - High loss: Emphasize robust MAE
   - Low loss: Emphasize precise MSE

4. **Combined Strategy**: Intelligently combines all weighting strategies

### Performance Tracking

- Training accuracy, best accuracy, and improvement tracking
- Memory usage monitoring with psutil
- Epoch timing and inference speed measurement
- Weight file size tracking
- Comprehensive CSV logging with unique configuration IDs
- Real-time error counting and logging

from data_loader import load_and_prepare_data

# Load particle physics simulation data
X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test, summary = load_and_prepare_data()

# Create advanced neural network with custom constraints
model = create_model(
    input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],),
    output_shape=y_train.shape[1]
)

# Configure training
config = {
    'epochs': 50,
    'batch_size': 32,
    'learning_rate': 0.001
}

# Train with comprehensive tracking
results = train_with_tracking(
    model, X_train, X_val, X_test,
    y_train, y_val, y_test, config
)
```

### Component Usage Examples

#### Binary Weight Constraints

```python
from weight_constraints import BinaryWeightConstraintChanges, BinaryWeightConstraintMax

# Limit additional binary precision
constraint_changes = BinaryWeightConstraintChanges(max_additional_digits=1)
constrained_weights = constraint_changes.apply_constraint(weights)

# Limit maximum binary digits
constraint_max = BinaryWeightConstraintMax(max_binary_digits=5)
constrained_weights = constraint_max.apply_constraint(weights)
```

#### Oscillation Dampening

```python
from weight_constraints import OscillationDampener

dampener = OscillationDampener(window_size=3)

# Add weights to history and detect oscillations
for epoch_weights in weight_sequence:
    dampener.add_weights(epoch_weights)
    dampened = dampener.detect_and_dampen_oscillations(epoch_weights)
```

#### Adaptive Loss Functions

```python
from adaptive_loss import AdaptiveLossFunction, epoch_weighted_loss

# Create adaptive loss with strategy
adaptive_loss = AdaptiveLossFunction(weighting_strategy='combined')

# Use in training loop
loss_value = adaptive_loss(y_true, y_pred)

# Standalone usage
combined_loss = epoch_weighted_loss(epoch=25, mse_loss=0.15, mae_loss=0.12)
```

#### Performance Tracking

```python
from performance_tracker import PerformanceTracker

tracker = PerformanceTracker(output_dir='training_output')

# Start training session
tracker.start_training(config)

# Track epochs
tracker.start_epoch(epoch)
tracker.end_epoch(epoch, logs)

# Add weight modifications
tracker.add_weight_modification('binary_constraints')

# Save results
tracker.save_results()
```

## Advanced Features

### Railway Programming Pattern

The implementation uses railway programming principles:

- **Graceful Degradation**: Components continue working even when some features fail
- **Error Tracking**: All errors are logged with counts and descriptions
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Alternative implementations when primary methods fail
- **Continuation**: Training continues even when individual components encounter errors

### Binary Weight Arithmetic

#### Precision Change Control Example

```
Previous weight: 1.001 (binary)
Allowed new weights: 11.001, 1.0011, 1.1001, 1.0101
Invalid: 11.0011 (too many additional digits)
Selected: 1.1001 (adds exactly one significant digit)
```

#### Maximum Precision Control Example

```
Weight: 1.001101 (binary)
Max precision: 4 digits
Result: 1.001 (truncated to fit constraint)
```

#### Oscillation Dampening Example

```
Weight history: [0.5, 0.7, 0.4] (up-down pattern)
Next update would create: up-down-up oscillation
Original weight: 1.1001 (binary)
After dampening: 1.1000 (smallest digit set to zero)
```

## Configuration

### Model Configuration

```python
config = {
    'hidden_layers': [64, 32, 16],           # Network architecture
    'activation': 'relu',                     # Activation function
    'dropout_rate': 0.2,                     # Dropout for regularization
    'optimizer': 'adam',                     # Optimizer choice
    'learning_rate': 0.001,                  # Learning rate
    'max_binary_digits': 5,                  # Max binary precision
    'max_additional_binary_digits': 1,       # Additional precision limit
    'oscillation_window': 3,                 # Oscillation detection window
    'loss_weighting_strategy': 'combined',   # Adaptive loss strategy
    'output_dir': 'training_output'          # Output directory
}
```

### Training Configuration

```python
training_config = {
    'epochs': 50,          # Number of training epochs
    'batch_size': 32,      # Batch size for training
    'learning_rate': 0.001 # Learning rate override
}
```

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Install all required dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib psutil
   ```

2. **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch size or model size

   ```python
   config = {'batch_size': 16, 'hidden_layers': [32, 16]}
   ```

3. **TensorFlow GPU Issues**: Force CPU usage
   ```python
   os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '-1'
   ```

### Error Recovery

The system is designed to continue operation even when components fail:

- **Weight Constraints**: Falls back to original weights if constraint fails
- **Adaptive Loss**: Uses MSE if adaptive computation fails
- **Performance Tracking**: Continues training if tracking fails
- **Data Loading**: Generates synthetic data if CSV loading fails
